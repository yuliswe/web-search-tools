# Start development

## MacOS

If you are setting up the repo for the first time, following these steps:

1. Make sure your ~/.zshrc file has the following lines:
```
   if [ -f ./.zshrc ] && [ \$(pwd) != ~ ]; then
     source ./.zshrc
   fi
```
2. Run the following commands: (You only need to do this once.)
```
   ./initenv.bash
```
3. Start a new terminal session.
